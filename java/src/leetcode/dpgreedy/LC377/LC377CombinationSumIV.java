/**
 * 377. Combination Sum IV
 *
 * Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates,
 * find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * nums = [1, 2, 3]
 * target = 4
 *
 * The possible combination ways are:
 * (1, 1, 1, 1)
 * (1, 1, 2)
 * (1, 2, 1)
 * (1, 3)
 * (2, 1, 1)
 * (2, 2)
 * (3, 1)
 *
 * Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
 *
 * Therefore the output is 7.
 *
 * Follow up:
 * What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
 * How does it change the problem?
 * What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
 *
 * Credits:
 * Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
