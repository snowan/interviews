## Problem: 2128 Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.

In one operation, you can choose any row or column and flip each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all 0‘s to 1‘s, and all 1‘s to 0‘s).

Return true if it is possible to remove all 1‘s from grid using any number of operations or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: One possible way to remove all 1’s from grid is to:
- Flip the middle row
- Flip the middle column

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to remove all 1’s from grid.


Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are no 1’s in grid.

Constraints:

m == grid.length n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300 grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.


## Solution

Find a pattern from given examples, notice that it will flip the whole row or column for every flip,
so it must equal or equal of the reverted row. otherwise it won't be possible to remove all ones. Once found the pattern, solution is easy.

1. use first row and reverted first row as patterns 
2. compare to all other rows with patterns from #1.
   a. if rows in patterns, continue 
   b. if rows not in pattern, then impossible to remove all ones, simply return False.
3. after all rows are in patterns, return True

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```python
from typing import List
def removeOnes(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return True
    row_patt, row_patt_revert = grid[0], [1 - x for x in grid[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(grid)):
        if grid[i] not in (row_patt, row_patt_revert):
                return False
    return True

```
